Tex Compiler is a simple Python script that provides on-the-fly preview
of LaTeX documents. 

It is mainly thought as a tool to help the creation of slides with Beamer. 
It can be used by passing the name of the main .tex file as the first parameter
on command line, and the name of the others following. For example: 

 ./tex_compiler.py main.tex chapter1.tex chapter2.tex ...

It will then monitor the files and automatically recompile main.tex when needed.
